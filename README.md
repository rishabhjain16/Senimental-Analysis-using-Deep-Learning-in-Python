# Senimental-Analysis-using-Deep-Learning-in-Python
Sentiment analysis refers to the identification/recognition of sentiment in natural language. There are many interesting and challenging issues in this domain and the problem has a range of application areas. In its most basic form, the sentiment analysis challenge has a passage of text and an associated sentiment classification (positive or negative, classically) and the goal is to learn the relationships between the text and the outcomes. 

There are many difficult cases involving two or more sentiment words being used in the sentence, ambiguity, difficulty with negations etc.

“Despite the wonderfully packaging, the product was poor”.
“The excellent acting and soundtrack could not save this movie.”



1. Describe the data and any pre-processing steps you undertook (10)
2. Choose a suitable NN architecture and justify your choice. (20)
3. Use TensorFlow to train on the data set and document your results. (40)
4. Discuss the performance of your model. (30)

    This could be achieved through:    
          
    i) Accuracy achieved – plots/tables of performance
        
    ii) Comparing your performance to an alternative model (you may choose a naïve approach to show the improvement obtained with your model from 2. 
          
    iii) Illustrating cases where it gives the incorrect result for unseen cases.
